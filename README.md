The field of synthetic biology, still in its early stages, has largely been driven by experimental expertise, and much of its success can be attributed to the skill of the researchers in specific domains of biology. There has been a concerted effort to assemble repositories of standardized components; however, creating and integrating synthetic components remains an ad hoc process. Inspired by these challenges, the field has seen a proliferation of efforts to create computer-aided design tools addressing synthetic biology's specific design needs, many drawing on prior expertise from the electronic design automation community.




##  Dry lab Overview
Our modelling work falls into four diverse but complementary categories, which assists wet lab work and overall insightful optimization of our Biofilm system for industrial water purification system.


#PartA: Molecular level:This approach demonstrates that the rational design and molecular dynamics simulation of Periplasmic binding proteins complex like Metallothioneins and metal binding peptide can develop metal-detecting living systems for potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental studies.

#PartB:Cell level:

#PartC:Population level:

#PartD:System level:
