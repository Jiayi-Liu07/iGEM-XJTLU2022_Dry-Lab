##  Dry lab Overview
Our modelling work falls into four diverse but complementary categories, which assists wet lab work and overall insightful optimization of our Biofilm system for industrial water purification system.


This approach demonstrates that the rational design and molecular dynamics simulation of Periplasmic binding proteins complex like Metallothioneins and metal binding peptide can develop metal-detecting living systems for potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental studies.
